<h2 id="_4">描述<a class="headerlink" href="#_4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>GraphicsMagick's gm provides a suite of utilities for creating, comparing, converting, editing, and displaying images. All of the utilities are provided as sub-commands of a single gm executable:</p>
<p><a href="animate/">animate</a> displays an animation (e.g. a GIF file) on any workstation display running an X server.</p>
<p><a href="batch/">batch</a> executes an arbitary number of the utility commands (e.g. convert) in the form of a simple linear batch script in order to improve execution efficiency, and/or to allow use as a subordinate co-process under the control of an arbitrary script or program.</p>
<p><a href="benchmark/">benchmark</a> executes one of the other utility commands (e.g. convert) for a specified number of iterations, or execution time, and reports execution time and other profiling information such as CPU utilization. Benchmark provides various operating modes including executing the command with a varying number of threads, and alternate reporting formats such as comma-separated value (CSV).</p>
<p><a href="compare/">compare</a> compares two images and reports difference statistics according to specified metrics and/or outputs an image with a visual representation of the differences. It may also be used to test if images are similar within a particular range and specified metric, returning a truth value to the executing environment.</p>
<p><a href="composite/">composite</a> composites images (blends or merges images together) to create new images.</p>
<p><a href="conjure/">conjure</a> interprets and executes scripts in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).</p>
<p><a href="convert/">convert</a> converts an input file using one image format to an output file with the same or differing image format while applying an arbitrary number of image transformations.</p>
<p><a href="display/">display</a> is a machine architecture independent image processing and display facility. It can display an image on any workstation display running an X server.</p>
<p><a href="identify/">identify</a> describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.</p>
<p><a href="import/">import</a> reads an image from any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.</p>
<p><a href="mogrify/">mogrify</a> transforms an image or a sequence of images. These transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction, and others. The transmogrified image overwrites the original image.</p>
<p><a href="montage/">montage</a> creates a composite by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image with the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.</p>
<p><a href="time/">time</a> executes a subcommand and reports the user, system, and total execution time consumed.</p>
<p><a href="version/">version</a> reports the GraphicsMagick release version, maximum sample-depth, copyright notice, supported features, and the options used while building the software.</p>
<p>The GraphicsMagick utilities recognize the following image formats:</p>

<p>模式:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> Read</li>
<li><code>w</code> Write</li>
<li><code>+</code> Multi-image</li>
</ul>
<p>Support for some of these formats require additional programs or libraries. See README in the source package for where to find optional additional software.</p>
<p>Note, a format delineated with + means that if more than one image is specified, frames are combined into a single multi-image file. Use +adjoin if you want a single image produced for each frame.</p>
<p>Your installation might not support all of the formats in the list. To get an accurate listing of the formats supported by your particular configuration, run "gm convert -list format".</p>
<p>Raw images are expected to have one byte per pixel unless gm is compiled in 16-bit quantum mode or in 32-bit quantum mode. Here, the raw data is expected to be stored two or four bytes per pixel, respectively, in most-significant-byte-first order. For example, you can tell if gm was compiled in 16-bit mode by typing "gm version" without any options, and looking for "Q:16" in the first line of output.</p>
<h2 id="_5">文件和格式<a class="headerlink" href="#_5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>By default, the image format is determined by its magic number, i.e., the first few bytes of the file. To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e.ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e.image.ps). The magic number takes precedence over the filename suffix and the prefix takes precedence over the magic number and the suffix in input files. When a file is read, its magic number is stored in the "image-&gt;magick" string. In output files, the prefix takes precedence over the filename suffix, and the filename suffix takes precedence over the "image-&gt;magick" string.</p>
<p>To read the "built-in" formats (GRANITE, H, LOGO, NETSCAPE, PLASMA, and ROSE) use a prefix (including the colon) without a filename or suffix. To read the XC format, follow the colon with a color specification. To read the CAPTION format, follow the colon with a text string or with a filename prefixed with the at symbol (@).</p>
<p>When you specify X as your image type, the filename has special meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or root. If no filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in the desired window.</p>
<p>Specify input_file as - for standard input, output_file as - for standard output. If input_file has the extension .Z or .gz, the file is uncompressed with uncompress or gunzip respectively. If output_file has the extension .Z or .gz, the file is compressed using with compress or gzip respectively.</p>
<p>Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after an input file name to specify a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD (e.g. "img0001.pcd[4]") or a range for MPEG images (e.g. "video.mpg[50-75]"). A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. "image.tiff[2,7,4]"). For raw images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g. -size 640x512 "image.rgb[320x256+50+50]"). Surround the image name with quotation marks to prevent your shell from interpreting the square brackets.</p>
<p>Single images are written with the filename you specify. However, multi-part images (e.g., a multi-page PostScript document with +adjoin specified) may be written with the scene number included as part of the filename. In order to include the scene number in the filename, it is necessary to include a printf-style %d format specification in the file name and use the +adjoin option. For example,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>image%02d.miff
</pre></div>


<p>writes files image00.miff, image01.miff, etc. Only a single specification is allowed within an output filename. If more than one specification is present, it will be ignored. It is best to embed the scene number in the base part of the file name, not in the extension, because the extension will not be a recognizeable image type.</p>
<p>When running a commandline utility, you can prepend an at sign @ to a filename to read a list of image filenames from that file. This is convenient in the event you have too many image filenames to fit on the command line.</p>
<h2 id="_6">选项<a class="headerlink" href="#_6" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any option or -noop. Some options only affect the decoding of images and others only the encoding. The latter can appear after the final group of input images.</p>
<p>This is a combined list of the command-line options used by the GraphicsMagick utilities (animate, compare, composite, convert, display, identify, import, mogrify and montage).</p>
<p>In this document, angle brackets ("<code>&lt;&gt;</code>") enclose variables and curly brackets ("{}") enclose optional parameters. For example, "-fuzz <code>&lt;distance&gt;</code>{%}" means you can use the option "-fuzz 10" or "-fuzz 2%".</p>
<details class="info"><summary>-adjoin</summary><p>join images into a single multi-image file</p><p>By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same file. However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support storing more than one image per file and only the first frame in an image sequence will be saved unless the result is saved to separate files. Use +adjoin to force saving multiple frames to multiple numbered files. If +adjoin is used, then the output filename must include a printf style formatting specification for the numeric part of the filename. For example,</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>image%02d.miff

Refer to -visual for more details. By default, a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients. Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look very different than intended. Choose Private and the image colors appear exactly as they are defined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the image colormap is installed.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-colors <code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>preferred number of colors in the image</p><p>The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request, but never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate or unused colors removed. The ordering of an existing color palette may be altered. When converting an image from color to grayscale, convert the image to the gray colorspace before reducing the number of colors since doing so is most efficient. Refer to <a href="./quantize.html">quantize</a> for more details.</p><p>Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and -treedepth affect the color reduction algorithm.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-colorspace <code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>the type of colorspace</p><p>Choices are: CineonLog, CMYK, GRAY, HSL, HWB, OHTA, RGB, Rec601Luma, Rec709Luma, Rec601YCbCr, Rec709YCbCr, Transparent, XYZ, YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, or YUV.</p><p>Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more closely than do distances in RGB space. These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image. Refer to quantize for more details.</p><p>Two gray colorspaces are supported. The Rec601Luma space is based on the recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). The Rec709Luma space is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suitable for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The GRAY colorspace currently selects the Rec601Luma colorspace by default for backwards compatibly reasons. This default may be re-considered in the future.</p><p>Two YCbCr colorspaces are supported. The Rec601YCbCr space is based on the recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). The Rec709CbCr space is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suitable for suitable for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The YCbCr colorspace specification is equivalent toRec601YCbCr.</p><p>The Transparent color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves the matte channel of the image if it exists.</p><p>The -colors or -monochrome option, or saving to a file format which requires color reduction, is required for this option to take effect.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-comment <code>&lt;string&gt;</code></summary><p>annotate an image with a comment</p><p>Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image, when writing to an image format that supports comments. You can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format characters listed under the -format option. The comment is not drawn on the image, but is embedded in the image datastream via a "Comment" tag or similar mechanism. If you want the comment to be visible on the image itself, use the -draw option instead.</p><p>For example,</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>-comment &quot;%m:%f %wx%h&quot;

Each image pixel is represented by red, green, and blue levels (which are equal for a gray pixel). MaxRGB is the maximum integral value which may be stored in the red, green, or blue channels of the image. Each image pixel may also optionally (if the image matte channel is enabled) have an associated level of opacity (ranging from opaque to transparent), which may be used to determine the influence of the pixel color when compositing the pixel with another image pixel. If the image matte channel is disabled, then all pixels in the image are treated as opaque. The color of an opaque pixel is fully visible while the color of a transparent pixel color is entirely absent (pixel color is ignored).</p><p>By definition, raster images have a rectangular shape. All image rows are of equal length, and all image columns have the same number of rows. By treating the opacity channel as a visual "mask" the rectangular image may be given a "shape" by treating the opacity channel as a cookie-cutter for the image. Pixels within the shape are opaque, while pixels outside the shape are transparent. Pixels on the boundary of the shape may be between opaque and transparent in order to provide antialiasing (visually smooth edges). The description of the composition operators use this concept of image "shape" in order to make the description of the operators easier to understand. While it is convenient to describe the operators in terms of "shapes" they are by no means limited to mask-style operations since they are based on continuous floating-point mathematics rather than simple boolean operations.</p><p>By default, the Over composite operator is used. The following composite operators are available:</p><ul><li>Over</li><li>In</li><li>Out</li><li>Atop</li><li>Xor</li><li>Plus</li><li>Minus</li><li>Add</li><li>Subtract</li><li>Difference</li><li>Divide</li><li>Multiply</li><li>Bumpmap</li><li>Copy</li><li>CopyRed</li><li>CopyGreen</li><li>CopyBlue</li><li>CopyOpacity</li><li>CopyCyan</li><li>CopyMagenta</li><li>CopyYellow</li><li>CopyBlack</li></ul><p>The behavior of each operator is described below.</p><details class="info"><summary>Over</summary><p>The result will be the union of the two image shapes, with opaque areas of change-image obscuring base-image in the region of overlap.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>In</summary><p>The result is simply change-image cut by the shape of base-image.

The default alpha channel type for new files is unspecified alpha. Existing alpha settings are preserved when converting from one TIFF file to another. When a TIFF file uses associated alpha, the image pixels are pre-multiplied (i.e. altered) with the alpha channel. Files with "associated" alpha appear as if they were alpha composited on a black background when the matte channel is disabled. If the unassociated alpha type is selected, then the alpha channel is saved without altering the pixels. Photoshop recognizes associated alpha as transparency information, if the file is saved with unassociated alpha, the alpha information is loaded as an independent channel. Note that for many years, ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick marked TIFF files as using associated alpha, without properly pre-multiplying the pixels.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}</summary><p>If the tiff:fill-order key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the bit fill order used while writing TIFF files. The normal default is "msb2lsb", which matches the native bit order of all modern CPUs. The only exception to this is when Group3 or Group4 FAX compression is requested since FAX machines send data in bit-reversed order and therefore RFC 2301 recommends using reverse order.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:group-three-options=<code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>If the tiff:group-three-options key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to set the group3 options tag when writing group3-compressed TIFF.

Note that some TIFF tags are required in order to be able to read the image data at all.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:report-warnings={false|true}</summary><p>If the tiff:report-warnings key is defined and set to true, then TIFF warnings are reported as a warning exception rather than as a coder log message. Such warnings are reported after the image has been read or written. Most TIFF warnings are benign but sometimes they may help deduce problems with the TIFF file, or help detect that the TIFF file requires a special application to read successfully due to the use of proprietary or specialized extensions.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:sample-format={unsigned|ieeefp}</summary><p>If the tiff:sample-format key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the sample format used while writing TIFF files. The default is "unsigned". Specify "ieeefp" in order to write floating-point TIFF files with float (32-bit) or double (64-bit) values. Use the tiff:bits-per-sample define to determine the type of floating-point value to use.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:max-sample-value=<code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>If the tiff:max-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as the maximum floating point value while reading or writing IEEE floating point TIFFs. Otherwise the maximum value is 1.0 or the value obtained from the file's SMaxSampleValue tag (if present). The floating point data is currently not scanned in advance to determine a best maximum sample value so if the range is not 1.0, or the SMaxSampleValue tag is not present, it may be necessary to (intelligently) use this parameter to properly read a file.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:min-sample-value=<code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>If the tiff:min-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as the minimum floating point value while reading or writing IEEE floating point TIFFs.

Value may be any in the range of 1 to 32, or 64 when the default 'unsigned' format is written, or 16/32/24/64 if IEEEFP format is written. Please note that the baseline TIFF 6.0 specification only requires readers to handle certain powers of two, and the values to be handled depend on the nature of the image (e.g. colormapped, grayscale, RGB, CMYK).</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:samples-per-pixel=<code>&lt;value&gt;</code></summary><p>If the tiff:samples-per-pixel key is defined to a value, the TIFF coder will write TIFF images with the defined samples per pixel, overriding any value stored in the image. This option should not normally be used.

Width and height should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple of 16, then it will be rounded down. Enables tiled TIFF if it has not already been enabled. GraphicsMagick does not use tiled storage internally so tiles need to be converted back and forth from the internal scanline-oriented storage to tile-oriented storage. Testing with typical RGB images shows that useful square tile size values range from 128x128 to 1024x1024. Large images which require using a disk-based pixel cache benefit from large tile sizes while images which fit in memory work well with smaller tile sizes.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>tiff:tile-width=<code>&lt;width&gt;</code></summary><p>Specify the tile width to use while writing tiled TIFF.

The primitives include shapes, text, transformations, and pixel operations. The shape primitives are</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>point           x,y
line            x0,y0 x1,y1
rectangle       x0,y0 x1,y1

</pre></div>

<p>The text primitive is</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>text            x0,y0 string
</pre></div>

<p>The text gravity primitive is</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gravity         NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center,
                East, SouthWest, South, or SouthEast
</pre></div>

<p>The text gravity primitive only affects the placement of text and does not interact with the other primitives. It is equivalent to using the -gravity commandline option, except that it is limited in scope to the -draw option in which it appears.</p><p>The transformation primitives are</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>rotate          degrees
translate       dx,dy
scale           sx,sy
skewX           degrees

</pre></div>

<p>The pixel operation primitives are</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>color           x0,y0 method
matte           x0,y0 method
</pre></div>

<p>The shape primitives are drawn in the color specified in the preceding -stroke option. Except for the line and point primitives, they are filled with the color specified in the preceding -fill option. For unfilled shapes, use -fill none
.</p><p>Point requires a single coordinate.</p><p>Line requires a start and end coordinate.</p><p>Rectangle expects an upper left and lower right coordinate.</p><p>RoundRectangle has the upper left and lower right coordinates and the width and height of the corners.</p><p>Circle has a center coordinate and a coordinate for the outer edge.</p><p>Use Arc to inscribe an elliptical arc within a rectangle. Arcs require a start and end point as well as the degree of rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90).</p><p>Use Ellipse to draw a partial ellipse centered at the given point with the x-axis and y-axis radius and start and end of arc in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150 0,360).</p><p>Finally, polyline and polygon require three or more coordinates to define its boundaries. Coordinates are integers separated by an optional comma. For example, to define a circle centered at 100,100 that extends to 150,150 use:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>-draw &#39;circle 100,100 150,150&#39;
</pre></div>

<p>Paths (See Paths) represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of moveto (set a new current point), lineto (draw a straight line), curveto (draw a curve using a cubic Bezier), arc (elliptical or circular arc) and closepath (close the current shape by drawing a line to the last moveto) elements. Compound paths (i.e., a path with subpaths, each consisting of a single moveto followed by one or more line or curve operations) are possible to allow effects such as "donut holes" in objects.</p><p>Use image to composite an image with another image. Follow the image keyword with the composite operator, image location, image size, and filename:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>-draw &#39;image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg&#39;
</pre></div>

<p>You can use 0,0 for the image size, which means to use the actual dimensions found in the image header. Otherwise, it will be scaled to the given dimensions. See -compose for a description of the composite operators.</p><p>Use text to annotate an image with text. Follow the text coordinates with a string. If the string has embedded spaces, enclose it in single or double quotes. Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format character. See -comment for details.</p><p>For example,</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>-draw &#39;text 100,100 &quot;%m:%f %wx%h&quot;&#39;
</pre></div>

<p>annotates the image with MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.</p><p>If the first character of string is @, the text is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.</p><p>Rotate rotates subsequent shape primitives and text primitives about the origin of the main image. If the -region option precedes the -draw option, the origin for transformations is the upper left corner of the region.</p><p>Translate translates them.</p><p>Scale scales them.</p><p>SkewX and SkewY skew them with respect to the origin of the main image or the region.</p><p>The transformations modify the current affine matrix, which is initialized from the initial affine matrix defined by the -affine option. Transformations are cumulative within the -draw option. The initial affine matrix is not affected; that matrix is only changed by the appearance of another -affine option. If another -draw option appears, the current affine matrix is reinitialized from the initial affine matrix.</p><p>Use color to change the color of a pixel to the fill color (see -fill). Follow the pixel coordinate with a method:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>point
replace
floodfill
filltoborder
reset
</pre></div>

<p>Consider the target pixel as that specified by your coordinate. The point method recolors the target pixel. The replace method recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel. Floodfill recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas filltoborder recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally, reset recolors all pixels.</p><p>Use matte to the change the pixel matte value to transparent. Follow the pixel coordinate with a method (see the color primitive for a description of methods). The point method changes the matte value of the target pixel. The replace method changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel. Floodfill changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas filltoborder changes the matte value of any neighbor pixel that is not the border color (-bordercolor). Finally reset changes the matte value of all pixels.</p><p>You can set the primitive color, font, and font bounding box color with -fill, -font, and -box respectively. Options are processed in command line order so be sure to use these options before the -draw option.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-edge <code>&lt;radius&gt;</code></summary><p>detect edges within an image</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-emboss <code>&lt;radius&gt;</code></summary><p>emboss an image</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-encoding <code>&lt;type&gt;</code></summary><p>specify the text encoding</p><p>Choose from AdobeCustom, AdobeExpert, AdobeStandard, AppleRoman, BIG5, GB2312, Latin 2, None, SJIScode, Symbol, Unicode, Wansung.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-endian <code>&lt;type&gt;</code></summary><p>specify endianness (MSB, LSB, or Native) of image</p><p>MSB indicates big-endian (e.g. SPARC, Motorola 68K) while LSB indicates little-endian (e.g. Intel 'x86, VAX) byte ordering.

The -flatten option accomplishes this composition. The sequence of images is replaced by a single image created by compositing each image in turn, while respecting composition operators and page offsets. While -flatten is immediately useful for eliminating layers, it is also useful as a general-purpose composition tool.</p><p>The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option. If the -flatten option appears after all of the input images, all images are flattened. Also see -mosaic which is similar to -flatten except that it adds a suitably-sized canvas base image.</p><p>For example, this composites an image on top of a 640x400 transparent black canvas image:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gm convert -size 640x300 xc:transparent \
        -compose over -page +0-100 \

By default, the window size is the image size and the location is chosen by you (or your window manager) when it is mapped.</p><p>For the 'import', 'convert', 'mogrify' utility commands it may be used to specify the desired size when resizing an image. In this case, symbols representing resize options may be appended to the geometry string to influence how the resize request is treated.</p><p>See later notes corresponding to usage by particular commands. The following notes apply to when -geometry is used to express a resize request, taking into account the current properties of the image.</p><p>By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.</p><p>Append a ^ to the geometry so that the image aspect ratio is maintained when the image is resized, but the resulting width or height are treated as minimum values rather than maximum values.</p><p>Append a ! (exclamation point) to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you specify. For example, if you specify 640x480! the image width is set to 640 pixels and height to 480.</p><p>If only the width is specified, without the trailing 'x', then height is set to width (e.g., -geometry 100 is the same as -geometry 100x100). If only the width is specified but with the trailing 'x', then width assumes the value and the height is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. Similarly, if only the height is specified prefixed by 'x' (e.g., -geometry x256), the width is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio.</p><p>To specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than 100.</p><p>Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.</p><p>Use ??? info "to change the dimensions of the image only if its width or height exceeds the geometry specification. <code>&lt; resizes the image only if both of its dimensions are less than the geometry specification. For example, if you specify '640x480&gt;</code>' and the image size is 256x256, the image size does not change. However, if the image is 512x512 or 1024x1024, it is resized to 480x480. Enclose the geometry specification in quotation marks to prevent the `&lt; or ??? info "from being interpreted by your shell as a file redirection.</p><p>When used with animate and display, offsets are handled in the same manner as in X(1) and the -gravity option is not used. If the x is negative, the offset is measured leftward from the right edge of the screen to the right edge of the image being displayed. Similarly, negative y is measured between the bottom edges. The offsets are not affected by "%"; they are always measured in pixels.</p><p>When used as a composite option, -geometry gives the dimensions of the image and its location with respect to the composite image. If the -gravity option is present with NorthEast, East, or SouthEast gravity, the x represents the distance from the right edge of the image to the right edge of the composite image. Similarly, if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South, or SouthEast gravity, y is measured between the bottom edges. Accordingly, a positive offset will never point in the direction outside of the image. The offsets are not affected by "%"; they are always measured in pixels. To specify the dimensions of the composite image, use the -resize option.</p><p>When used as a convert, import or mogrify option, -geometry is synonymous with -resize and specifies the size of the output image. The offsets, if present, are ignored.</p><p>When used as a montage option, -geometry specifies the image size and border size for each tile; default is 256x256+0+0. Negative offsets (border dimensions) are meaningless. The -gravity option affects the placement of the image within the tile; the default gravity for this purpose is Center. If the "%" sign appears in the geometry specification, the tile size is the specified percentage of the original dimensions of the first tile. To specify the dimensions of the montage, use the -resize option.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-gravity <code>&lt;type&gt;</code></summary><p>direction primitive gravitates to when annotating the image.</p><p>Choices are: NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast.</p><p>The direction you choose specifies where to position the text when annotating the image.

The size of the Hald CLUT image is determined by its order. The width (and height) of a Hald CLUT is the cube of the order. For example, a Hald CLUT of order 8 is 512x512 pixels (262,144 colors) and of order 16 is 4096x4096 (16,777,216 colors). A special CLUT is the identity CLUT which which causes no change to the input image. In order to use the Hald CLUT, one takes an identity CLUT and adjusts its colors in some way. The modified CLUT can then be used to transform any number of images in an identical way.</p><p>GraphicsMagick contains a built-in identity CLUT generator via the IDENTITY coder. For example reading from the file name IDENTITY:8 returns an identity CLUT of order 8. Typical Hald CLUT identity images have an order of between 8 and 16. The default order for the IDENTITY CLUT generator is 8. Interpolation is used so it is not usually necessary for CLUT images to be very large. The PNG file format is ideal for storing Hald CLUT images because it compresses them very well.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-help</summary><p>print usage instructions</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-highlight-color <code>&lt;color&gt;</code></summary><p>pixel annotation color</p><p>Specifies the color to use when annotating difference pixels.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-highlight-style <code>&lt;style&gt;</code></summary><p>pixel annotation style</p><p>Specifies the pixel difference annotation style used to draw attention to changed pixels.

Result is computed as pow(value,rvalue). Similar to Gamma except that rvalue is not inverted.
RShift
Result is channel value bitwise right shifted by rvalue bits.
Subtract
Result is channel value minus rvalue.
Threshold
Result is maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue, or minimum (black) if it is less than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.
Threshold-white
Result is maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue and is unchanged if it is less than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove apparent noise from the bright parts of an image. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.
Threshold-White-Negate
Result is set to black if channel value is greater than rvalue and is unchanged if it is less than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.
Threshold-black
Result is minimum (black) if channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if it is greater than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove apparent noise from the dark parts of an image. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.
Threshold-Black-Negate
Result is set to white if channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if it is greater than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.
Xor
Result is the logical XOR of rvalue with channel value. An interesting property of XOR is that performing the same operation twice results in the original value.
Noise-Gaussian
Result is the current channel value modulated with gaussian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.
Noise-Impulse
Result is the current channel value modulated with impulse noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.
Noise-Laplacian
Result is the current channel value modulated with laplacian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.
Noise-Multiplicative
Result is the current channel value modulated with multiplicative gaussian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.
Noise-Poisson
Result is the current channel value modulated with poisson noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.
Noise-Random
Result is the current channel value modulated with random (uniform distribution) noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue. The initial noise intensity (rvalue=1.0) is the range of one pixel quantum span.
Noise-Uniform
Result is the channel value with uniform noise applied according to the intensity specified by rvalue.</p><p>As an example, the Assign operator assigns a fixed value to a channel. For example, this command sets the red channel to the mid-range value:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gm convert in.bmp -operator red assign &quot;50%&quot; out.bmp
</pre></div>

<p>The following applies 50% thresholding to the image and returns a gray image:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gm convert in.bmp -operator gray threshold &quot;50%&quot; out.bmp

When channeltype is "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is dithered. When a color channel is specified, only that channel is dithered.</p><p>The choices for N are 2 through 7. The image is divided into NxN pixel tiles. In each tile, some or all pixels are turned to white depending on their intensity. For each N, (N**2)+1 levels of gray can be represented. For N == 2, 3, or 4, the pixels are turned to white in an order that maximizes dispersion (i.e., reduces granularity), while for N == 5, 6, and 7, they are turned to white in an order that creates a roughly circular black blob in the middle of each tile. An attractive "half-tone" looking image can be obtained by first rotating the image 45 degrees, performing a 5x5 ordered-dither operation, then rotating it back to the original orientation and cropping to the original image dimensions. If the original image is gamma-encoded, it is adviseable to convert it to linear intensity first, e.g., with the "-gamma 0.45455" option.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-output-directory <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code></summary><p>output files to directory</p><p>Use -output-directory to specify a directory under which to write the output files.

The algorithm used preserves all of the input path specification in the output path so that the user-specified input path (including any sub-directory part) is appended to the output path. If the input file lacks an extension, then a suitable extension is automatically added to the output file. The user is responsible for creating the output directory specified as an argument, but subdirectories will be created as needed if the -create-directories option is supplied. This option may be used to apply transformations on files from one directory and write the transformed files to a different directory.

<p>For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger, etc.). Otherwise, -page behaves much like -geometry (e.g. -page letter+43+43&gt;`).</p><p>This option is also used to place subimages when writing to a multi-image format that supports offsets, such as GIF89 and MNG. When used for this purpose the offsets are always measured from the top left corner of the canvas and are not affected by the -gravity option. To position a GIF or MNG image, use -page{+-}<code>&lt;x&gt;</code>{+-}`&lt;y??? info "(e.g. -page +100+200). When writing to a MNG file, a -page option appearing ahead of the first image in the sequence with nonzero width and height defines the width and height values that are written in the MHDR chunk. Otherwise, the MNG width and height are computed from the bounding box that contains all images in the sequence. When writing a GIF89 file, only the bounding box method is used to determine its dimensions.</p><p>For a PostScript page, the image is sized as in -geometry and positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by {+-}<code>&lt;xoffset&gt;</code>{+-}<code>&lt;y offset&gt;</code>. Use -page 612x792&gt;`, for example, to center the image within the page. If the image size exceeds the PostScript page, it is reduced to fit the page. The default gravity for the -page option is NorthWest, i.e., positive x and y offset are measured rightward and downward from the top left corner of the page, unless the -gravity option is present with a value other than NorthWest.</p><p>The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.</p><p>This option is used in concert with -density.</p><p>Use +page to remove the page settings for an image.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-paint <code>&lt;radius&gt;</code></summary><p>simulate an oil painting</p><p>Each pixel is replaced by the most frequent color in a circular neighborhood whose width is specified with radius.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-pause <code>&lt;seconds&gt;</code></summary><p>pause between animation loops [animate]</p><p>Pause for the specified number of seconds before repeating the animation.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-pause <code>&lt;seconds&gt;</code></summary><p>pause between snapshots [import]</p><p>Pause for the specified number of seconds before taking the next snapshot.</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-pen <code>&lt;color&gt;</code></summary><p>(This option has been replaced by the -fill option)</p></details><details class="info"><summary>-ping</summary><p>efficiently determine image characteristics</p><p>Use this option to disable reading the image pixels so that image characteristics such as the image dimensions may be obtained very quickly.

Profiles may be excluded from subsequent listed matches by preceding their name with an exclamation point. For example, +profile '!icm,<em>' strips all profiles except for the ICM profile. Use identify -verbose to find out what profiles are in the image file. Use +profile "</em>" to remove all profiles.</p><p>Writing the image to a format that does not support profiles will of course also cause all profiles to be removed. The JPEG and PNG formats will store any profiles that have been read and not removed.

This non-linear equation is intended to loosely approximate the quality provided by the JPEG v1 format. The default quality value 75 results in a request for 16:1 compression. The quality value 100 results in a request for non-lossy compression.</p><p>For the MNG and PNG image formats, the quality value sets the zlib compression level (quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10). Compression levels range from 0 (fastest compression) to 100 (best but slowest). For compression level 0, the Huffman-only strategy is used, which is fastest but not necessarily the worst compression.</p><p>If filter-type is 4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">none</span>

The quality setting has no effect on the appearance of PNG and MNG images, since the compression is always lossless.</p><p>For further information, see the PNG specification.</p><p>When writing a JNG image with transparency, two quality values are required, one for the main image and one for the grayscale image that conveys the opacity channel. These are written as a single integer equal to the main image quality plus 1000 times the opacity quality. For example, if you want to use quality 75 for the main image and quality 90 to compress the opacity data, use -quality 90075.</p><p>For the PNM family of formats (PNM, PGM, and PPM) specify a quality factor of zero in order to obtain the ASCII variant of the format.

The -type option may be used to tailor the output subformat. By default the output subformat is based on readily available image information and is usually similar to the input format.</p><p>Specify -type Optimize in order to enable inspecting all pixels (if necessary) in order to find the most efficient subformat. Inspecting all of the pixels may be slow for very large images, particularly if they are stored in a disk cache. If an RGB image contains only gray pixels, then every pixel in the image must be inspected in order to decide that the image is actually grayscale!</p><p>Sometimes a specific subformat is desired. For example, to force a JPEG image to be written in TrueColor RGB format even though only gray pixels are present, use</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gm convert bird.pgm -type TrueColor bird.jpg
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly, using -type TrueColorMatte will force the encoder to write an alpha channel even though the image is opaque, if the output format supports transparency.</p><p>Some pseudo-formats (e.g. the XC format) will respect the requested type if it occurs previously on the command line. For example, to obtain a DirectClass solid color canvas image rather than PsuedoClass, use</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>gm convert -size 640x480 -type TrueColor xc:red red.miff
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise, specify -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte prior to reading a Postscript (or PDF file) in order to influence the type of image that Ghostcript returns.

This usually substantially improves repeated read performance since the file is already in memory after the first time it has been read. However, testing shows that performance may be reduced for files accessed for the first time since data is accessed via page-faults (upon first access) and many operating systems fail to do sequential read-ahead of memory mapped files, and particularly if those files are accessed over a network.
